            <p>My name is Zayne Lockhart. I've been working toward the goal of becoming a Data Analyst for about 4 years now. My journey began in 2020 when I decided to learn Python as a hobby. I have continued to pursue mastery of Python and its various libraries over the last four years, however, during that time I have also begun to broaden my horizons by learning SQL, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, R, and many other programs/languages/pieces of tech that are endemic to this field. Currently, I serve my community as an EMT, play music with my band, and enjoy several other hobbies in my free time! Thank you for visiting my portfolio page and I look forward to getting the opportunity to work in this field.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Mushroom Occurence In Alabama</h3>
            <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zayne.lockhart/viz/MushroomData_17063665067830/Sheet1?publish=yes">Mushroom Occurence Chart</a>
            <p>This project is one I'm quite fond of. I gathered species-specific data from INaturalist and imported it to Excel where I did some minor cleaning and organization of said data. I then Imported that data into Microsoft SQL Server where I cleaned it further in preparation for visualization. Finally the .csv of the cleaned table was inported to Tableau where I was able to use the geographic data to mark the locations of mushrooms. I also created sliding filters for the date of observation and the species so one can find exactly what they are looking for and see how the trends change over time.</p>
            <h3>Employee Salary Exploratory Analysis</h3>
            <p><a href="EmployeeSalaryAnalysis.html">Employee Salary Analysis Charts and Scripts</a></p>
            <p><a href="AnotatedSalaryAnalysis.html">Employee Salary Analysis With Comments Explaining the Code</a></p>
            <p>This project was completed entirely in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. The goal of my analysis was to find out the average salary of Data Analysts in the US based on this study and to see what the trend is based on experience level. The results were very much in line with what one would expect. From entry level to mid level, and mid level to senior, each step up provided a nicely proportional salary increase.</p>
